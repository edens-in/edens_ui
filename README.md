# Next.js Frontend Application

This is a frontend-only [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application designed to connect to external APIs. It is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (version 20 or later) and npm installed.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running Locally

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on [Render](https://render.com/). The deployment settings are defined in the `render.yaml` file in the root of the project.

For more detailed instructions on deploying Next.js applications to Render, please refer to Render's official documentation:
